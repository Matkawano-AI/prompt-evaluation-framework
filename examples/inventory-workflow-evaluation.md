# Example: Evaluating AI Output for an Inventory Workflow

This example shows how the evaluation checklist is applied
before using AI-generated guidance in a real system.

---

## Scenario

An AI assistant is prompted to suggest improvements
to a manual inventory tracking process.

---

## AI Output (Simplified)

> “You should automate inventory updates and add a dashboard
> to visualize stock levels.”

---

## Evaluation Using the Checklist

**1. Goal Alignment**
- ✅ Relevant to improving inventory tracking.

**2. Constraint Compliance**
- ⚠️ Lacks constraints: does not specify what can or cannot be changed.

**3. Clarity & Specificity**
- ❌ Too vague to act on (no steps, no scope).

**4. Logical Consistency**
- ✅ Internally consistent but incomplete.

**5. Risk & Assumption Awareness**
- ❌ Assumes automation tools are available without confirmation.

---

## Decision

The output is **not usable as-is**.

A follow-up prompt is required to:
- Clarify scope
- Add constraints
- Produce actionable steps
