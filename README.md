# Prompt Evaluation Framework

This repository outlines a **practical, lightweight approach** to evaluating
large language model (LLM) outputs when used in real workflows.

The focus is on **judgment and validation**, not model training or benchmarking.

## Why Output Evaluation Matters

LLMs can produce fluent responses that appear correct
but contain subtle errors, omissions, or violations of constraints.

In real workflows, unvalidated AI output can lead to:
- Silent logic errors
- Misleading recommendations
- Broken downstream processes

For this reason, prompt engineering must include
**explicit evaluation and validation steps**, not just generation.
